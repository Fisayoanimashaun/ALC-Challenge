# ALC-Challenge
ALC 4.0: Phase 1 Challenge- Mobile Web

This Challenge is aimed at verifying a Credit Card for payment.


I implemented the Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
I also implemented a detect card function that detects the type of card based on the first digit of the card number.
